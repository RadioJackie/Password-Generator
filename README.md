Transfered all the nececary files over from homework-03 to Password-Generator.

Started working on my JS.

Made a useless js that is overly complicated.

Forgot to make and connect my Git Repo so did that.

Made a semi usable Js code, made my first commit to my Repo.

Unsure weather i'm on the right track with my second commit.

JS script is a mess and I can't make my button display, making another commit and going to bed

Got some help now my JS is finally back on track and looking useable, reorganized my code.

Got the button to display with lines 22-28

Reorganized again and got rid of useless code.
